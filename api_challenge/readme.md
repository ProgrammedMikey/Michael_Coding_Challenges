# Michaels API Challenge

## Thank you for the opportunity

### What language do I code in?
I decided to go with nodejs and express. 
Make sure you have node installed then when inside the folder api_challenge you can run: npm install and  npm start

Once running you can load up Postman or Insomnia and test the routes 

`GET /api/tree`
`POST /api/tree/` 


### 1. `GET /api/tree` return the entire tree - in the following format;

### 2. `POST /api/tree/` with the payload of the format

```
{
    "parent": "<id>",
    "label": "<label>"
}
```
