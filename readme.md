Congratulations! You've made it to the project stage of our interview process.
There are 2 projects included in this repository, which you can learn about under the api_challenge and minesweeper directories. To help make this process as realistic as possible, please follow the below steps:

- Create a new project with an empty repository on Github.
- For each project, open the directory and view additional instructions in its README.
- Finally, share your repository with `@jalford5` and `@jasonlynx` with Admin access so we can review and share with additional team members as needed.

If you have any questions or require more time to complete these challenges, don't hesitate to reach out.
